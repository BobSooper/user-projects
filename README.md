# Contact
If you want me to code some projects for you, feel free to contact me. The best way to do so is by joining my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/w9z7EYw). <br>
Please note that there are requirements that need to be met, and they will apply to almost all projects that I make. You can find these in **REQUIREMENTS.md**.
